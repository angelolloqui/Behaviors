iOS Behaviors
======

This Swift library contains a set of usefulf behaviors implemented to simplify your iOS projects. The concept behind this approach is explored in [objc.ios Issue 13](http://www.objc.io/issue-13/behaviors.html).


Why use Behaviors?
---------------

Check out the [objc.io issue 13](http://www.objc.io/issue-13/behaviors.html) for extra details, but basically Behaviors allow you to write better code by pushing to the maximum extent concepts like Composition and Single Responsibility Principle. By using Behaviors, you can compose your views with multiple small objects from your InterfaceBuilder and dramatically reduce the amount of lines in your `UIViewController`. 
The resulting code is more reusable and testable.
